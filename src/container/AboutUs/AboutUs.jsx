          <b>KVADRAT</b> is a multidisciplinary office that focuses on
          architecture and design, from large scale planning to interior design.
          Rich with multiple expertises, our office is fuelled by talented
          designers and experienced architects that jointly develop projects
          from early sketches to on-site supervision. At the core of our
          architecture is the ability to take a fresh look at design issues
          through experienced eyes. Our approach aims at turning intense
          research and analysis of practical and theoretical matters into the
          driving forces of design.
